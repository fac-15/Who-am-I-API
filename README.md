## Lessons learnt

### Add event listener 

We tried and tried to get the event listeners to work and it just wouldn't. Finally we realised that we shouldn't have put event listeners on the submit button because our button was in a form. The event listener needed to be put on the form. 

### Testing 

We're still not comfortable with tape, but we tried our best to write tests before the function. Things we learnt: don't try to test API functions.
